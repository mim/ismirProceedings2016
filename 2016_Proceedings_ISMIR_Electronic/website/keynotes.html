      <h2 id="key1">Keynote Talk 1: Integrating Music Information Sources for Music Production and Consumption</h2>
      <h3>Speaker: Mark Sandler (Queen Mary University of London, UK)</h3>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
        For several years, research at Queen Mary's Centre for Digital Music has probed the
        intersection of signal analysis technologies with informatics technologies. More specifically,
        we have built audio signal-level feature extractors which output RDF―the language of the
        Semantic Web―which have enabled us to build prototypes that expose enhanced
        functionality and offer new experiences to music users of all kinds. This talk will summarise
        some of our early and recent work in Semantic Audio and Music Informatics, leading up to
        the current research themes of our FAST-IMPACt (Fusing Audio and Semantic Technologies
        for Intelligent Music Production and Consumption) project. FAST-IMPACt is a 5 year
        programme of research involving 3 UK universities together with commercial and
        non-commercial partners from around the world. Its overarching aim is to bring more
        engaging and immersive experiences based on musical knowledge of all kinds to users of all
        kinds. Where relevant and possible, the principles will be illustrated with demos.

      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p>
        Mark Sandler was born in 1955. He received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the University
        of Essex, U.K., in 1978 and 1984, respectively. His PhD was an investigation into Digital
        Audio Power Amplification and he has been an active researcher in Digital Audio and Digital
        Music ever since. He is a Professor of Signal Processing at Queen Mary University of
        London, London, U.K., where he founded the Centre for Digital Music and he has published
        over 400 papers in journals and conferences and supervised over 30 PhD students. Mark
        Sandler is currently Director of the EPSRC/AHRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Media
        and Arts Technology, and Principal Investigator of the 5 year research project, Fusing Audio
        and Semantic Technologies for Intelligent Music Production and Consumption. Mark is a
        Fellow of the Institute of Engineering and Technology (FIET), a Fellow of the Audio
        Engineering Society (FAES), a Fellow of the British Computer Society (FBCS), and a Fellow
        of the Institution of Electronic and Electrical Engineers (FIEEE).

      <h2 id="key2">Keynote Talk 2: The Promise of Music Information Retrieval: Are we there yet?</h2>
      <h3>Speaker: J. Stephen Downie (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA)</h3>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
        In 1988, I needed to find some easy-to-play music for an upcoming flute performance exam.
        As a famously mediocre flute player, I was more than a little desperate to find something that
        would require the least amount of rehearsal time (and talent) to perform. I had previously
        played a baroque piece in the key of C that just might fit the bill. After too many hours of
        searching that included innumerable consultations with infinitely patient music librarians and
        fellow music students, we finally determined that the work in question was Bach's Flute
        Sonata in C, BWV 1033. This real-world use case inspired me to ask: "Why is it so difficult
        to identify, and then locate, a rather famous piece of music that I had actually played before?"
        In this talk, I reflect on just how far music information retrieval research (MIR) has come in
        the intervening 27 years in making access to music resources quick and simple. As I expound
        on my personal journey as an MIR researcher, I will note some of the twists in the road that I
        have surprised me. I will also offer up some commentary on lesser-travelled paths that we as
        community should explore.

      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p>
        J. Stephen Downie is the Associate Dean for Research and a Professor at the Graduate School
        of Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
        Downie is the Illinois Co-Director of the HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC). He is also
        Director of the International Music Information Retrieval Systems Evaluation Laboratory
        (IMIRSEL) and founder and ongoing director of the Music Information Retrieval Evaluation
        eXchange (MIREX). Stephen Downie was the Principal Investigator on the Networked
        Environment for Music Analysis (NEMA) project, funded by the Andrew W. Mellon
        Foundation. Furthermore, he is Co-PI on the Structural Analysis of Large Amounts of Music
        Information (SALAMI) project, jointly funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF),
        the Canadian Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), and the UK's Joint
        Information Systems Committee (JISC). Stephen Downie has been very active in the
        establishment of the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) community through his ongoing
        work with the International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) conferences.
        He was ISMIR's founding President and now serves on the ISMIR board. Professor Downie
        holds a BA (Music Theory and Composition) along with a Master's and a PhD in Library and
        Information Science, all earned at the University of Western Ontario, London, Canada.
