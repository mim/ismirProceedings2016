      <h2>Preface</h2>
      <p>
          It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 16th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference
          (ISMIR 2015). The annual ISMIR conference is the world’s leading research forum on processing, analyzing, searching,
          organizing, and accessing music-related data. This year’s conference, which takes place in Málaga, Spain,
          from October 26th – 30th, 2015, is organized by the ATIC Research Group of the Universidad de Málaga.
      </p>
      <p>
        The present volume contains the complete manuscripts of all the peer‐reviewed papers presented at ISMIR 2015.
        A total of 278 submissions were received before the deadline, out of which 242 complete and well‐formatted papers
        entered the review process. Special care was taken to assemble an experienced and interdisciplinary review panel
        including people from many different institutions worldwide. As in previous years, the reviews were double‐blinded
        (i.e., both the authors and the reviewers were anonymous) with a two‐tier review model involving a pool of 257 reviewers
        and a program committee. Reviewers and PC members were able to bid for papers. Each paper was assigned to a PC member
        and three reviewers. Reviewer assignments were based on topic preferences, bids, and PC member assignments. After the
        review phase, PC members and reviewers entered a (name‐disclosed) discussion phase aiming to homogenize acceptance vs. rejection decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to previous years, the size of the program committee increased significantly and now comprises 61 members.
        Taking care of four submissions on average, the PC members were asked to adopt an active role in the review process
        by conducting an intensive discussion phase with the other reviewers and by providing a detailed meta-review. Final
        acceptance decisions were based on 973 reviews and meta‐reviews. From the 242 reviewed papers, 114 papers were accepted
        resulting in an acceptance rate of 47.1 %. The table shown on the next page summarizes the ISMIR publication statistics over
        the last years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mode of presentation of the papers was determined after the accept/reject decisions and has no relation to the quality
        of the papers or to the number of pages allotted in the proceedings. From the 114 contributions, 24 papers were chosen for
        oral presentation based on the topic and broad appeal of the work, whereas the other 90 were chosen for poster presentation.
        Oral presentations have a 20-minute slot (including setup and questions/answers from the audience) whereas poster presentations
        are done in two sessions per day, the same posters being presented in the morning and in the afternoon of a given conference day.

        late‐breaking/demo &amp; unconference sessions. Moreover, a satellite event called “Hacking
        Audio and Music Research” (HAMR) is offered, which is held on October 24th and 25th. We
        now give a summary of the highlights of the conference.

    <h2>MIREX</h2>
    <p>
      The Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX) is a collective effort to
      evaluate cutting-edge methods for various MIR tasks. Since 2005, MIREX has been an
      integral part of ISMIR. This year, ISMIR features the following MIREX-related events:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Plenary summary of tasks and results of MIREX 2015</li>
        <li>Report of the “Grand Challenge 2015: User Experience” (GC15UX)</li>
        <li>Plenary discussion of MIREX 2016 and GC16UX</li>
        <li>Poster session of MIREX 2015 participants</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Late-Breaking/Demo &amp; Unconference</h2>
    <p>
      Friday afternoon is dedicated to late-breaking papers and MIR system demonstrations.
      Abstracts for these presentations are available online. Moreover, as in previous years, we
      have a special “unconference” session in which participants break up into smaller groups to
      discuss MIR issues of particular interest. This is an informal and informative opportunity to
      get to know peers and colleagues from all around the world.
    </p>

    <h2>Music Program</h2>
    <p>
      ISMIR 2015 includes a music program, which is centered around one curated concert that
      takes place on Wednesday, October 24th, at Sala Unicaja de Conciertos María Cristina. The
      aim of the concert program is two-fold: to encourage the use of Music Information Retrieval
      (MIR) techniques in the creation of new music and to explore music that can suggest novel
      ideas for research in the MIR field.
    </p>

    <h2>Social Events</h2>
    <p>
      ISMIR 2015 not only offers interesting papers, posters, and tutorials, but also aims at giving
      the participants an unforgettable stay. The social program provides participants with an
      opportunity to relax after meetings, to experience Málaga, and to network with other ISMIR
      participants. The social program includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Monday, October 26, Welcome cocktail at “Vinoteca Museo Los Patios de Beatas”.</li>
        <li>Wednesday, October 28, Concert at “Sala de Conciertos María Cristina” that
            includes, not only the music from the “ISMIR 2015 Call for Music” but also Live
            Flamenco Dancing &amp; Music.</li>
        <li>Thursday, October 29, Gala Dinner at “Hacienda del Alamo” and ISMIR 2015
            Pandora Jam Session.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conference Venue</h2>
    <p>
      More than 3,000 years of history have passed since Málaga’s establishment by the
      Phoenicians. Today, Málaga is a beautiful, friendly, and cosmopolitan city that enchants
      tourists from all over the world. The conference venue is the hotel NH MALAGA, located in
      the heart of Málaga’s city centre. The venue is within walking distance to main attractions,
      including the Cathedral, the Picasso Museum, Larios Street, Muelle 1 (Pier 1), Alcazaba, and
      the sea promenade. Be sure to take the chance to explore Málaga and enjoy your stay in Spain!
